# Samuel Kuczynski Plotly Deployment

## Overview of Project

### We are working with Roza to help complete an interactive dashboard hosted through github pages so that we can vizualize our bacterial data for each volunteer. We would like to have each volunteer be able to identify the top 10 bacteria in their belly buttons. We were successfully able to create a vizualization using a bar graph method first.
