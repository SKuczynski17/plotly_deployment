## Overview of Project

### We are working with Roza to help complete an interactive dashboard hosted through github pages so that we can vizualize our bacterial data for each volunteer. We would like to have each volunteer be able to identify the top 10 bacteria in their belly buttons. We were successfully able to create a vizualization using Bar Graph, Bubble Chart, & Gauge Chart method first. 

## Deliverables

### There were 4 main objectives we attacked during this task.
    - Part 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
    - Part 2: Create a Bubble Chart
    - Part 3: Create a Gauge Chart
    - Part 4: Customize the Dashboard
